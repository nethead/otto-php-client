The aim is to help you as a partner of OTTO Market to connect to and to work with the OTTO Partner API. It describes some common implementation patterns and helps you to understand how processes work. Detailed information about the concrete interfaces can be accessed by clicking onto the single tabs.  ## Authorization (OAuth2)  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->  ### Fetch access token  In order to fetch an authorization token you must have an API user with a password. You can use the following cURL command to receive your token. Make sure to include your username and password in the command (without leading and trailing < >) and to URL-encode special characters appropriately. ``` curl -X POST \\   https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\   -d 'username=<YourUsername>&password=<YourPassword>&grant_type=password&client_id=token-otto-api' ```  Alternatively, you can let cURL encode the POST data by using `--data-urlencode` instead: ``` curl -X POST \\   https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\   --data-urlencode username=<YourUsername> \\   --data-urlencode password=<YourPassword> \\   --data-urlencode grant_type=password \\   --data-urlencode client_id=token-otto-api ```  The response of the request will look like the following example. The token itself can be extracted from the <code class=\"inline\">access_token</code> value. ``` {   \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiISInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJTd3ExRDRvYVBKUFQzMER3dmlZRkVVV2hRaEJtMEdPRlpWVWIwYWEteDBjIn0.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.Rszr6jXUUGGHzqw2XVo7HcaZ0pHvwYyJdg0olZEwpkz2lNBPejFPDuHK5eUrKEBxOhAsu3zKXwrfcyMWW8iufAbfCEonlDjle7U3NafLT-ITcjiL0wf1oI0D33h37RKmd0KjBXcoZRyvGZEUoItMp1WNGLn0JV8UvSOqDiGeCHvuurLNb91aIIHNMuN8lRQLaOhCKRmKsnxpUOytNcOER0_Z_sbK3x4fWJuaEDLIf6OGmx6TXZQr5e2UnvtOIWpt_JMvnKoJOC2-cPN5MP-PiMKTodi7ajhavUxo7dWyE0eBvc2stMFhjwSJO1KUkGjHdk0PWt-4GNlAdBze3laR2Q\",   \"expires_in\": 1800,   \"refresh_expires_in\": 7200,   \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI5YjRjZjM1Yi0yZDBkLTQzZGUtYWVjMC1kZTUzMDNiYjM3YjEifQ.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.X02NuyvlIhGL6L6fDGvdW-NSLCpFFIc4Cf8XbA_bBdk\",   \"token_type\": \"bearer\",   \"not-before-policy\": 0,   \"session_state\": \"3e0710b2-b57a-4cb0-a51d-6de60a997356\",   \"scope\": \"pumba-roles-app-portal partner email profile\" } ```  ### Use refresh token The refresh token can be extracted from the <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code> value. Once the access token is expired you can use the refresh token to get a new access token, without using your users credentials again. You can use the following cURL command. Include the refresh token (without leading and trailing < >). ``` curl -X POST \\   https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\   -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\   -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=token-otto-api' ```  The reponse of this request will look like the example above, the access token can be extracted from <code class=\"inline\">access_token</code> and the new refresh token from <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code>.  ### Use access token  When you decode the access token you will see information including your email, name and roles as well as usual token metadata:  ``` {   \"jti\": \"b76250a9-a69f-45fe-9191-d42c68da051e\",   \"exp\": 1584988534,   \"nbf\": 0,   \"iat\": 1584984934,   \"iss\": \"https://esb-ws.otto.de/sec-api/auth/realms/otto-partner\",   \"sub\": \"790bfdb1-12de-4964-bf38-ad5712978658\",   \"typ\": \"Bearer\",   \"azp\": \"token-otto-api\",   \"auth_time\": 0,   \"session_state\": \"81476119-17a4-414b-a4da-aec6f737ddf4\",   \"acr\": \"1\",   \"scope\": \"openid pumba-roles-app-portal partner email profile\",   \"email_verified\": true,   \"partner_id\": \"1000000\",   \"realm_access\": {     \"roles\": [       \"Products_Read\",       ...     ]   },   \"name\": \"Example User\",   \"preferred_username\": \"api_example\",   \"given_name\": \"Example\",   \"family_name\": \"User\",   \"email\": \"example.user@example.org\" } ```  ## Calling an Endpoint All endpoints are secured via authorization. You add the HTTP <code class=\"inline\">Authorization</code> -Header with value <code class=\"inline\">Bearer ey...</code> and will get access. ``` curl -X GET \\   https://api.otto.market/v2/orders \\   -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5jdhstdheSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI4T1d6MjhuZ01GbHBURDl5TGtxQkRHMThuYXZNVFgyTWtqNVhkY0RITDBZIn0.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.SleUexNdapaY5RmrVTbKRMiVpRrbNLjIUi7fILsW1hkpqQbX4IQRaSufSt98Ar0OkEmIvZvYPpGVecmjwYvD3YQzBmlcdU0V544Y0h8y01RyxZAYGZbRXfA1kOsFDucnrClCcj1JIaQMU4629wU9OM_SdQaLvfTA2l5prma94RekdWR3S-6DzXqJDtHrrcYS8BsfohkuLdi1U8vPUjwee9lsY3RTa9YZVekH4hFVWMl0Pbwub8jwum6zRjTu-ZAiLhZSnl8mSaMtrJFmkzRi3-s9eN7k0lnLKWGt7JuqZ_vbiJT8ZhHvPur4eLrY02ehF6-lwSUyjWMCzCi5TjBgYg' ```  The expected result has an HTTP 200 code with a probably empty list.  ## Rate Limiting In general requests are limited to 20 requests per second per partner-id as received inside the header. Exceeding the rate limit results in a HTTP 429 \"too many requests\" error. For some endpoints the rate limit is lower to ensure the best quality for all API users. Please see below:  |Endpoint path|HTTP method|Max requests per time unit| |:-|:-|:-| |/products|GET|10 per second| |/products|POST|20 per second| |/products/active-status|GET|10 per second| |/products/active-status|POST|3600 per day| |/products/marketplace-status|GET|10 per second| |/products/categories|GET|10 per second| |/products/brands|GET|10 per second|   ### Need A high volume of calls on API services at any given time would increase server resource consumption. If the load is due to an unauthorized intrusion it would be a chaos. Thus, Rate limiting becomes extremely important.  ### User Based API Throttling A general method of limiting usage of API resource is to allocate a pre-configured static or dynamic quota for a consumer.The API rate limiting is done on the basis of partner-id. A particular partner-id can make 20 requests per second.  ### Best practice Don't batch-process if possible (when every partner processes data once every hour, we have a clogged system once every hour and nothing to do the reset of the time).  ## Timeouts and Defaults | Name            | Value | Description                                                                                                    | |-----------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | request timeout | 10s   | The maximum HTTP request timeout for all interfaces                                                            | | limit           | 128   | The default for limit query parameter. See Paging. The default limit can be overwritten in specific interfaces.|  ## Common Patterns ### Interface Definition Our REST interface definitions are basically using swagger.io. All interface definitions can be automatically used by you to generate necessary API objects and similar in your chosen implementation language. In order to remain technically extensible and up-to-date, individual interfaces may have been described in new or different definition schemes. We are constantly trying to keep all interfaces technically up to date.  ### Versioning The OTTO Partner API uses different versions for the single endpoints. The version number is included in the URL path. [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme is used, but only the major version. Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions. API version is required in all urls.  Endpoints may introduce new optional fields at any time in the request and any new fields in the response. The client must skip all unknown fields.  For every endpoint, a changelog exists which displays the latest released changes and the upcoming unreleased changes. Additionally, an overall [Changelog](/) exists with the most exciting changes about the API in general. ### Supporting old versions The OTTO Partner API continues to support old versions of an API for **6 months** from the time of public announcement for the new version of a given API. It is recommanded to check regularly. This can be be automated by checking HTTP headers.  __example:__ ``` Warning: v2 is deprecated. Please migrate to v3 Sunset: Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT Deprecation: Wed, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT Link: <https://api.otto.market/v3/orders>; rel=\"successor-version\" ```  ## Header Some common headers should be set by clients:  1. Set the <code class=\"inline\">X-Request-Timestamp</code> header according to the [ISO-8601](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) standard. You can use this regex pattern: <code class=\"inline\">^\\d{4}-(0\\d|1[0-2])-([0-2]\\d|3[01])T(2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d:[0-5]\\d(\\.\\d+)?([+-](2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d|Z)$</code> 2. Set <code class=\"inline\">Accept</code> to the desired response format e.g. <code class=\"inline\">application/json</code> 3. Set the <code class=\"inline\">Content-Type</code> header to define the used format in the request body, only applicable if you send a request body  ### HTTP Methods The interfaces describe which HTTP methods are allowed and how to use them. Our basic concern is that basically all HTTP Methods are allowed in the [standardized way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). Note that these methods should behave as specified by their [standardized meaning (idempotency)](http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/idempotency/). The following is a description of a few special features, relevant facts or ways to use some of the HTTP methods. <details>   <summary>Click to expand for details</summary>  ### POST POST will update specific fields **and** returns the result like a GET would do (error response is independent).  ### PUT PUT will create or replace the whole entity independent of an existing entity.  ### PATCH PATCH will update specific fields **and** not return data like a GET would do (error response is independent). PATCH body is structured in the same way as PUT and POST (entity body). All fields added into your body will be updated, other fields will not be affected.  __example:__ ``` {   \"username\" : \"myusername\",   \"email\" : null } ``` </details> ## HTTP Status Codes We are using [standardized HTTP status code](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html) with a body only if needed (it also just can be empty), but details about that you can find at the concrete interface implementation.  | Verb   | Description  | |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | HEAD   | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | | GET    | Used for retrieving resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | | POST   | Used for creating resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | | PATCH  | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has title and body attributes. A PATCH request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource. PATCH is a relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept POST requests. | | PUT    | Used for replacing resources or collections. For PUT requests with no body attribute, be sure to set the Content-Length header to zero.                                                                                                                                                                 | | DELETE | Used for deleting resources.                                                                                                           |  ## Error Message Style Error messages are returned as content type \"application/json;charset=utf-8\" in the following format: ``` {   \"errors\": [     {       \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",       \"title\":  \"Invalid Attribute\",       \"code\": \"490\",       \"detail\": \"First name must contain at least three characters.\",       \"detail-structured\": {...},       \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/firstname\",       \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"     }   ],   \"warnings\": [       {         \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",         \"title\":  \"Warning Attribute\",         \"code\": \"WRONG_SPELLING\",         \"detail\": \"Last name should start with big letter.\",         \"detail-structured\": {...},         \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/lastname\",         \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"       }     ] } ```  Field             | Mandatory | Description ----------------- | --------- | ----------- path              | yes       | called REST path title             | yes       | short description of the error code              | no        | internal error code (number or enum) of your application / domain (do not use the HTTP status codes) detail            | no        | long description of the error, perhaps technical details detail-structured | no        | technical details in JSON structure jsonpath          | no        | JSON field in request which caused the error logref            | no        | reference key to find more stuff in the log (as example traceId)  ## Pagination All interfaces return a list with resources (orders, shipments...) and a next link if more entries exist. Use the next link to retrieve more entries.  For pagination, the basic query parameter \"limit\" (e.g. <code class=\"inline\">?limit=10</code>) can be used to define the maximum amount of resulting entities returned per call. The interface itself can reduce the limit lower than your client limit.  An example entity would be: ``` {   resources: [     {       ...data of the entity if all or some information will be provided directly...,       links: [         {           href: \"/v1/orders/1234\",  <--- Link to single partner order           rel: \"self\"         }       ]     }   ],   links: [     {       href: \"/v1/orders?idGt=1234\", <--- Link to next list of ressources. If not present, no more records exist, currently       rel: \"next\"     }   ] } ```  ## Bulk requests If you send a bulk request for an API endpoint, it will be processed asynchronously at the backend.  ### Synchronous Answer Synchronously will be delivered an endpoint to check the asynchronous processing state. ``` HTTP STATUS 202 (Accepted) {     \"task\": {         \"href\": \"/interface/foo/123\",         \"id\": \"123\"     } } ```  ### Check the State of an Endpoint The client can follow the <code class=\"inline\">href</code> to check the state of processing. An example entity would be: ``` {   \"state\": \"pending\",   \"message\": \"is running boy\",   \"progress\": \"35\",   \"total\": \"100\",   \"pingAfter\": \"2019-05-01T13:25:12+0200\",   \"links\": [     {       \"rel\": \"self\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123\"     },     {       \"rel\": \"failed\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/failed\"     },     {       \"rel\": \"succeeded\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/succeeded\"     }   ] } ```  ### Fetching files like PDF and CSV  Clients don't have to know the filetype that will be returned from a resource. Resources serving files will have the appropriate file extension in the URL as shown in the example below.  **Request Headers** ``` GET /SomeInvoice.pdf HTTP/1.1 Accept: *_/_* ```  Clients can find out the mime-type from the Content-Type header that will be sent in the response (e.g. application/pdf for PDF files and application/csv for CSV files).  **Response Headers**    ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 514493 Content-Type: application/pdf ```  ## Common fields Common fields like time, currency, country codes etc need to follow the standard ISO guidelines unless mentioned otherwise. The fields must report the format they are following on the docs.  ### Some standard formats: - Time: Accept in any time zone in ISO 8601 format and always reply in UTC.    Example: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `hh:mm:ss.sss`: `2020-03-12` and `22:33:34.400` - Currency: ISO 4217.    Example: `EUR` for Euros, `GBP` for British Pound Sterling. - Country code: ISO-3166-1 alpha-3    Example: `DEU` for Germany, `NOR` for Norway.  # Sandbox  ⚠️ we cannot provide the endpoint of quantities in the sandbox environment!  ## General **Sandbox is the test environment,** used for testing an API connection. It provides all the functionalities of the live OTTOmarket Interface. All actions and orders there are simulated for testing purposes.  The login session and the API key in the sandbox environment are completely separated from the production environment. You may [send us an e-mail](mailto:support@otto.market) to get an API key.  REST API: **https://sandbox.api.otto.market**  ## How-to Test Follow these steps to start testing on our sandbox environment:  1.  Make yourself familiar with sandbox functionalities. 1.  Request a sandbox API user from our team via [e-mail](mailto:support@otto.market). 1.  Authenticate to our sandbox environment. See [DevelopersGuide](/docs#section/Partner-API-Developer's-Guide) for further information. 1.  Use our Order generator to create fictional orders. See Technical Advice below to know, which orders are created. 1.  Test the API functionality of your application.  ## Products: Validation and test cases  ### Validation  Submitted product data is validated in two steps:  **1. Technical validation**  The first technical validation (syntax and required attributes) takes place after you´ve sent product data using a POST request. Read more about uploading products here: OTTO Market API: Create or update your product variations. If your http request was successful (http response state 200), you´ll be provided with four different links (pending, succeeded, failed, unchanged). Following the links you´ll be able to check which products have been successfully listed, failed, unchanged or are still being processed.  |Status|Explanation| |:-|:-| |Pending|The product listing is still being processed| |Succeeded|The shown products listing was successful| |Failed|Listing of all shown products has failed| |Unchanged|The request for the listed products is unchanged to the last request|  **2. Shop validation**  The second step is the shop validation. Results of the shop validation are retrievable using the marketplace-status endpoint. Please read OTTO Market API: Read the marketplace status on how to use the marketplace status endpoint. Submitted product data always has one of the following four marketplace statuses:  |Status |Explanation              | |:-------|:-------------------------| |Pending|Submitted product data is currently proceeded.| |Online|The SKU is displayed at otto.de. You can find the SKU using the shop link. <br />In some cases, additional information will be shown on how to improve the visibility on otto.de.| |Restricted|The SKU is not displayed at otto.de because of an error shown within the error’s container.| |Inactive|The SKU was set inactive via the active-status endpoint and could be reactivated via the active-status endpoint.|  **Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated.  ### Test cases  To ensure you´re able to test every marketplace status including different errors we´ve added specific EAN´s to our sandbox environment. Below you´ll find predefined test cases to simulate possible cases from the live environment. As mentioned before the different states are retrievable fetching the marketplace status.  **Test case #1: Status Online with poor data quality:**  A product status can be online but still have poor data quality. To increase the visibility please add the listed attributes from the error message (“{0}”).  This state can be tested by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:  - “6250000000010” - “6250000000027” - “6250000000034” - “6250000000041” - “6250000000058”  You should receive an error message that looks anything like this:  800001 - DATAQUALITY_NOTICE_SIGNIFICANT_ATTRIBUTE_AND_INFORMATION: “Durch die Pflege folgender Attribute kann die Sichtbarkeit des Produktes gesteigert werden: ''{0}''”  **Test case #2: Status Restricted – Brand blocked**  Some brands are reserved for specific sellers. By listing a product with one of those reserved brands you should receive the following error message:  600007- BRAND_BLOCKED and error title: “Die Marke ist gesperrt und darf nicht eingespielt werden.“ This state can be tested by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:  - “6250000000065” - “6250000000072” - “6250000000089” - “6250000000096” - “6250000000102”  **Test case #3: Status Restricted – EAN already known**  To ensure a great customer experience, product listings using the same EAN are grouped on the OTTO market. This leads to seller competition. By listing a product with a yet unknown EAN a new moin will be generated and must be included in all future updates / listings for that EAN. The moin is retrievable via the marketplace status.  By listing a product with an already known EAN you´ll be prompted with the following error message:  700001 - MOIN_ALREADY_KNOWN and the error title: “Diese Variante ist auf dem OTTO Marktplatz bereits bekannt. Um die Variante zum Verkauf anbieten zu können, bestätigen Sie uns bitte den Content, indem sie die MOIN beim nächsten Update an uns zurückschicken.“  The error message says that the EAN is already known and can only be sold by including the moin. The moin is retrievable from the marketplace status. Including the moin means you´re agreeing that you´re selling the exact same product which has initially generated the moin for the EAN you´re trying to sell. If you disagree, please contact support@otto.market.  The listing of a product with an already known EAN is possible by listing SKU´s using one or more of the following EAN´s:  - “6250000000201” - “6250000000300” - “6250000000409” - “6250000000508” - “6250000000607” - “6250000000706” - “6250000000805” - “6250000000904” - “6250000001000”  **Test case #4: Status Restricted – MOIN incorrect**  It´s possible that you´re trying to submit a product including the moin but the moin has a typo / is wrong in general. You´ll receive the following error message then:  700002 – MOIN_INCORRECT and the error title: “Die von Ihnen zu dieser Variante übertragene MOIN entspricht nicht der von uns für diese Variante vergebenen MOIN. Bitte überprüfen Sie ihre Daten und korrigieren die MOIN entsprechend.“  This is solved by including the correct moin.   ## Technical Advice Please note the following information: ### Authorization For the endpoint like all the other endpoints a valid authorization token has to be sent. If you need further information, please consult the [Developers Guide](/docs#section/Partner-API-Developer's-Guide).  ### GET-Returns Endpoint Since there are no real costumers, returns cannot be announced. Hence, the GET endpoint of returns is retrieving an empty string.  ### Sandbox Reset To prevent data overload, our sandbox and its orders are resetted monthly at first Sunday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\\ Any dynamic data (shipments, returns) is deleted. Old shipments will not be available anymore.\\ Therefore, you have to create new Orders every month.  ### Order Generator To test your API implementation you can generate test orders only on the sandbox environment by sending an empty POST request to the following generation endpoint:  [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders]()  This will run 8 predefined scenarios on our sandbox. After the POST request, you will receive 6 orders in \"PROCESSABLE\" status with different combinations of positions and items (e.g. standard and freight delivery). You will also receive 1 prepayment orders in \"ANNOUNCED\" and 1 orders in \"CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE\" status.  The generated orders will contain one or more position items with the following products:  | Product Title                       | EAN           | SKU                   | |-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------| | Smartphone »CallMe 1000«            | 1245780164732 | SmartCM1000-schwarz-1 | | Fancy Shirt »Flower«                | 4851278936452 | FancyFlower-m-pi      | | Rasenmaeher »Turbo V1«              | 9821393948573 | 0440-Rasen-T-V1       | | Spedition Wohnlandschaft 3.tlg.     | 8263748321943 | Sped-Wohn-3-98735     | | Spedition Kühlschrank »COOL EXTREM« | 7263000981290 | Sped-Kühl084-kombi    |  Scenarios:  | Scenarios        | Status                   | Comment                                                                | |------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 | PROCESSABLE              | Scenario 4 inclusive discount                                                                       | | 5                | ANNOUNCED                | Prepayment Order which is announced (Customer has not paid yet)        | | 6                | CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE | Prepayment Order which has been cancelled, because customer didn’t pay |  Please use the generated orders to test the interaction with Orders, Shipments and Returns.  If you want to create a single scenario you can do that by sending an empty POST to:  [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario\\{scenarionumber\\}]()  e.g. [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario1]()
